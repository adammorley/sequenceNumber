# sequence generator design
#
# in many database implementations, sequences are available to allow customers to create an ordering of events in a datastore.  this sequence generator implements a sequential number generator which allows consumers to get an ever increasing sequence number.
#
# it will be extended to persist the sequences, and later to replicate them, and finally to request them over the network.
#
# general use case: 
#
#	discover group using dns name (eg: sequencer.myweb.com)
# 	open conenction to any node in group on configurable port
#	make call get-id to endpoint
#	endpoint generates sequence number
#	later: endpoint replicates sequence number
#	later: endpoint persists current sequence number
#	endpoint returns sequence number
#
#
# wire format: leverage protocol buffers
#
# 	request: {'time': 'utc time', 'request': 'get', 'scope': 'sequenceNumber', 'request-id': 'client-generated string'}
	reply: {'reply': 'sequenceNumber', 'sequenceNumber'
